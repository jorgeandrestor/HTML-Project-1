        Releasing in April 2019, the Adidas Alphaboost was a combination of two
        of Adida's most popular sillhouettes- the Alphabounce and the
        UltraBoost. <br />The sneaker is considered to be "GR" (general
        release), and is easily found in stores and online for MSRP
        (manufacturer's suggested retail price ) or lower.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adidas's Boost technology makes the shoes incredibly comfortable
        underfoot for days spent standing in front of a classroom, and the
        breathable material makes it a very comfortable summer shoe.

        The first colorway of the Yeezy 350 V2 released in September of 2016, a
        year after Kanye West saw great success with his Yeezy 350 V1. The black
        colorway pictured here released in November of 2019, and many other
        colorways are constantly releasing. Unfortunately, due to the popularity
        of the brand, these sneakers are hard to come by without turning to
        reseller markets, but several re-releases have improved the availability
        pool, overall lowering prices.
      </p>

      <h5>
        Fit
      </h5>
      <p>
        In terms of fit, the low cut and Boost technology make these very
        comfortable in terms of the sole of the foot. The breathable material
        makes this another ideal summer shoe, but it should generally be avoided
        on cold winter days or any time there is rain out. Unfortunately, the
        narrowness of the toebox restricts comfort for wearers with wide feet.

        Number 3- Air Jordan 1 Shadow and Air Jordan 1 Royal Blue

        The iconic Air Jordan 1 first released in 1995, and was Michael Jordan's
        first signature shoe. Although the most iconic colorway of the original
        releases is the black and red (nicknamed "Bred") colroway, the black and
        gray "Shadow" colorway pictured is lauded for its flexibility in fitting
        into many different outfits. The Shadow 1s have been re-released (
        "retroed") 4 times, with the most recent being in 2018. However, the
        high demand for the colorway coupled with a relatively limited release
        has some sizes selling at 4 or 5 times the MSRP.
      </p>

      <p>
        Similarly, the Royal Blue colorway (the favorite colorway of this
        website's author) was also an original (OG) colorway release, and has
        retroed several times, most recently in 2017. Again, due to limited
        quantity and popular demand, this is another sneaker that sells for many
        times its initial value on reseller markets.
      </p>

      <h5>
        Fit
      </h5>

      <p>
        This is the first high-top shoe on the list, which comes with its pros
        and cons. A high top offers a lot of ankle support, but takes more time
        to put on. On a more subjective note, high top sneakers are generally
        considered to not be summer sneakers, with many opting for low tops
        instead. A slightly narrow toebox and limited cushioning underfoot makes
        these slightly less comfortable to wear throughout an entire day.

      <h2>
        Number 2- Vans Sk8-HI in Navy

      <p>
        The SK8-HI is a sneaker that saw a rise in popularity in the 1970s, and
        has been a staple of many people's wardrobes since. The model first
        found success amongst skaters, who liked the sneaker for its
        affordability and looks. Today, the SK8-HI has transcended many
        different cultural circles, and is a really excellently priced and cool
        looking option for those looking to get into the sneaker game. The
        SK8-HI is easily found on many websites and in stores, and the Navy
        colorway pictures is both very popular and very easy to purchase.
      </p>

      <h5>

      <p>
        Another high top that makes the list, these sneakers are, in the
        writer's opinion, a lot more flexible than the Air Jordan 1s in terms of
        style. The canvas upper makes them relatively breathable, enabling them
        for more adequate use as a summer shoe. There is limited cushioning
        underfoot, but the rubber outsole makes them an excellent dancing shoe,
        and a larger toebox allows for more comfort for wide-foot wearers.

      <h2>
        Number 1- Nike Air Force 1 Low in White
      </h2>
      <img
        src="https://stockx.imgix.net/Nike-Air-Force-1-Low-White-07-Product.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&auto=format,compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1561409052"
      />
      <p>
        The Air Force 1 High Top was Nike's first entry into the basketball
        sneaker game. A low version released in 1982, the same year as the high
        top. Although the Air Force 1s were discontinued in the 80's, they have
        returned full force in the 21st century, becoming one of the most iconic
        sneakers in the world. With countless mentions in musical lyrics, wide
        use across pivotal sneaker markets (basketball players, skaters,
        dancers), and a silhouette that is considered timeless, the Air Force 1
        may be the most popular shoe on this list. Affordability is also a huge
        factor here- at $90.00 USD, the cost of entry for a pair of these
        sneakers is very low compared to others on this list. Plus, white goes
        with everything!
      </p>

      <h5>
        Fit
      </h5>

      <p>
        The lowtop version of this shoe is very easy to slip on and off. The Air
        Max technology used in the sole of the sneaker makes it incredibly
        comfortable to wear for long days, and the ample toebox allows a lot of
        comfort for sneakerheads with wide feet. The breathability allows the
        AF1s to be used in the summer, but the solid construction makes it a
        passable winter shoes as well.
